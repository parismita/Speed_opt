2) medium test
* adjClustBand_heap is hclust hence compare this with rioja
* merge and gain data Heaphop and adjClustBand_heap compare
* rioja gain data not available compare merge only
* comparision.Rmd + pdf


3) hard test
* function description html page + pdf
* introduce parallal computing (PRAM) such that time const O(n) or O(logn) on Kruskal's algo


# link of files: 
* rioja folder files are independent of each otherI
* heaphop : source("chaclust") in similarity.R
* source("similarity.R") in comp.R

Target After Completion of all tests:
* try Chazelle-MST comp speed O(n) or inverse Ackermann Type Complexity (possibly PRAM not possible here)
