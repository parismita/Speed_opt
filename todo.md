#todo

1) analysis on easy test easy.Rmd and its pdf

2) medium test
* comp.R comparision b/w heaphop and rioja
* heaphop is not hclust object check how to make hclust object from heaphop soln
* similarity.Rmd + pdf
* comparision.Rmd + pdf


3) hard test
* function description html page + pdf
* single linkage function:
* introduce parallal computing (PRAM) such that time const O(n) or O(logn) on Kruskal's algo
* try Chazelle-MST comp speed O(n) or inverse Ackermann Type Complexity (possibly PRAM not possible here)

4) link of files: 
* rioja folder files are independent of each otherI
* heaphop : source("chaclust") in similarity.R
* source("similarity.R") in comp.R
