# todo:
1) medium test
* adjClustBand_heap is hclust hence compare this with rioja
* merge and gain data Heaphop and adjClustBand_heap compare
* rioja gain data not available compare merge only
* comparision.Rmd + pdf


2) hard test
* introduce parallal computing (PRAM) such that time const O(n) or O(logn) on Prim's algo


# Target After Completion of all tests:
* try Chazelle-MST comp speed O(n) or inverse Ackermann Type Complexity (possibly PRAM not possible here)
