## Single Linkage Criterion
In Single Linlage Criterion of Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, The distance between the elements of each cluster is minimised. As the Naive single linkage clustering has a worst case time complexity of O(N^3). It becomes useless for large data which are frequency used in the field of bioinformatics

Hence Nearest-neighbor chain algorithm is being used here

## Nearest-neighbor chain algorithm
In the theory of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. And Single Linkage Clustering is one of them.

## The Algorithm
* Initialize the set of active clusters to consist of n one-point clusters, one for each input point.

* Let S be a stack data structure, initially empty, the elements of which will be active clusters.

* While there is more than one cluster in the set of clusters:

* If S is empty, choose an active cluster arbitrarily and push it onto S.

* Let C be the active cluster on the top of S. Compute the distances from C to all other clusters, and let D be the nearest other cluster.

* If D is already in S, it must be the immediate predecessor of C. Pop both clusters from S and merge them.

* Otherwise, if D is not already in S, push it onto S.

Here The cost function used is the minimum distance between the nearest cluster element.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/point.png')
```

As single linkage criterion can be implemented by using the Lance and William Algorithm
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/william.png')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/lance.png')
```

Hence by tuning the cost function of FusionedClasses.cpp

```
FusionCost = 0.5 * (MyValue()  - abs(MyValue() - MyMatrix->Value(NextAvailableIndex,
    NextAvailableIndex)) + MyMatrix->Value(NextAvailableIndex, NextAvailableIndex));
```
## The Output
```
h<-5
resP <- chaclust(s,h)
View(head(t(resP),10))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/output.png')
```
