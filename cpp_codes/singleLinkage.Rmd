## Single Linkage Criterion
In Single Linlage Criterion of Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, The distance between the elements of each cluster is minimised. As the Naive single linkage clustering has a worst case time complexity of O(N^3). It becomes useless for large data which are frequency used in the field of bioinformatics. 

Here by restricting the data to h-band similarity matrix and using min-heap we reduce the time complexity to O(plogp + ph)

#The Input
The input is taken as Cosine Similarity matrix which is then converted into Distance Matrix in file adjClustBand_heap.R

```
matL <- .toMatLeft(xt, p, h)     ## a matrix p x h (with zeros at the bottom) of the LD values
dissim <- as.numeric(1 - matL)    ## cosine distance metric
```

#The Output
The output is a hclust object with details of gain, height, label, merge data, order etc.

```
tree <- list(traceW=traceW,
                 gains=gains,
                 merge = res,
                 height = height,
                 seqdist = height,
                 order = 1:p,
                 labels = paste("",1:p),
                 method = "adjclust-heaps",
                 call = match.call(),
                 dist.method = attr(D, "method"))
    class(tree) <- "hclust"
```

## The Algorithm

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/algo1.png')
```

## Computation of Minimum Distance via SLINK

```
  for(int i=mini;i<=maxi;i++)
  {
    for(int j=minj-i;(j<=maxj-i)&&(j<=h);j++)
    {   
    res = MIN(DIS(i,j,p),res);
    }
}
```
Where the number of items in cluster I is mini - maxi and cluster J is minj - maxj.
In loop-2 the constrain that the difference between index of item must not exceed h is applied.

## Comparision with Rioja
Taking parameter h as the width of the matrix we get similar results as chclust function of rioja with conslink method.

* The output by rioja chclust (conslink)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/output1.png')
```

* The output by adjClustBand_heap

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/output2.png')
```

Comparing the Merge Data of both the functions we get same values initially and it deviates a little at higher heights.

* The Merge Data by chclust (conslink)

```
    #Recalculating the similarity matrix as s_re = 2-2*s' and rechecking the rioja cluster value
    s_re <- 2 - 2*s_scaled
    
    #rioja hclust object
    diss <- as.dist(s_re)
    clust <- chclust(diss, method = "conslink")
    View(cbind(clust$merge ,height = clust$height))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/r.png')
```

* The Merge Data by adjClustBand_heap

```
    # hclust object using adjClustBand_heap function
    # where s_scaled is the similatrity matrix
    h<- ncol(s_scaled)
    fit <- chaclust(s_scaled,h,f = 1)
    plot(fit)
    View(cbind(fit$merge ,height = fit$height))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('~/cHAC/a.png')
```

Though the Height is different, the overall height of dendrogran is almost same around ~0.4 and the merge data of clusters are same as shown in the data table.
